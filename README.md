# Automatic-Sunlight-Detection-Window-Blind
This project is an abstraction of an automatic blinds system which opens during a detected sunrise and closes during a detected sunset. This system uses an ATMEGA328P, light sensor and a step motor for the core functionality. This is however only an abstraction as nothing is connected to the step motor. In practice the step motor would be connected to a gear which would be binned to a rotational roll which would open and close the blinds. Meaning if the step motor turns clockwise the blinds close and if the step motor rotates anticlockwise the blinds open.

This repository contains the code which is uploaded to the arduino for the stepper motor to function and its documentation.
